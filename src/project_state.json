    "Hero section should only use the ship-with-containers background image; remove the additional right-side hero image (freight-hero.dim_1920x800.png).",
    "Ensure text over hero/background images meets accessible contrast (adjust overlay/text colors as needed so text is not hidden).",
    "Shipment tracking page should present as 'Coming soon' with disabled submit button until tracking is implemented.",
    "Hero headline, supporting paragraph, and stats labels on the ship-with-containers hero background should use a light/white text color to maintain contrast against the image.",
    "Frontend project should be runnable locally: ensure frontend/package.json contains proper Vite (and app) dependencies and standard scripts (dev/build/preview), so `pnpm install` + `pnpm run dev` works on a fresh download.",
    "Ensure frontend/package.json includes all actual app dependencies referenced in code (e.g., @tanstack/react-query and any router libs) so imports resolve and `pnpm run dev` works.",
    "Blank page likely caused by `frontend/src/main.tsx` rendering nothing: `ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render()` is missing its JSX tree (e.g., `<React.StrictMode><QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}><App /></QueryClientProvider></React.StrictMode>`). Ensure `main.tsx` mounts `<App />` (and providers) into `#root`.",

    "Hero section headline/paragraph/stats text is not readable against the background; set to white/light (and/or adjust overlay) for sufficient contrast.",
    "Downloaded project’s frontend/package.json appears incomplete/incorrect for local dev (no/incorrect scripts or missing Vite dependency), causing `pnpm run dev` / `vite` command failures on Windows.",
    "Local dev build fails due to missing dependency/import for `@tanstack/react-query` (error at `import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from \"@tanstack/react-query\";`), indicating package.json dependencies are incomplete/out of sync with code.",
    "Local app shows a blank page because `frontend/src/main.tsx` calls `ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render()` with no React element tree; nothing is mounted to `#root` (should at least render `<App />`, optionally wrapped in `QueryClientProvider`).",
