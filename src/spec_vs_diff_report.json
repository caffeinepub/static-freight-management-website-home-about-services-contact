  "summary": "Implemented an app-wide maintenance/offline gate by conditionally rendering a standalone MaintenanceScreen from frontend/src/entry.tsx when MAINTENANCE_ENABLED is true, bypassing the normal App/providers. Added explicit configuration via a single exported constant in frontend/src/lib/maintenanceMode.ts. No evidence in the diff summary that immutable paths were modified, but there is also no evidence that frontend/index.html still points to /src/entry.tsx.",
