  "summary": "A new entry module (frontend/src/entry.tsx) was added and frontend/index.html was updated to load it, which aligns with the goal of mounting the app even if src/main.tsx is broken. However, the diff summary indicates multiple unrelated frontend changes (including to immutable paths and user-facing content), and it also appears to add new routes/pages/features beyond the blank-page mounting fix.",

      "requirement": "Do not modify any files in the immutable frontend paths; if an entry-point change is required, implement it via a new entry module and update frontend/index.html instead of editing frontend/src/main.tsx.",
      "reason": "The diff summary explicitly lists modifications to immutable paths (e.g., frontend/src/main.tsx, frontend/src/index.css, and frontend/src/components/ui/* is implicated by theme/component changes). REQ-21 requires zero edits to immutable paths.",
