# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update site branding to “Di Logisolutions/Di Logisolution” by replacing the header logo/brand and updating company contact and address details across the UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the provided logo image `frgmtlogo.png` to `frontend/public/assets/` and replace the current header branding (icon + “GlobalFreight”) with the logo and the company name “Di Logisolutions”, ensuring the header brand links to Home and remains legible in light/dark themes.
- Update all visible company/contact details (footer and Contact page at minimum) to:
  - Office Address: “Di LOGISOLUTIONS, A89, ROAD NO 2, MAHIPALPUR, NEW DELHI,110037”
  - Phone: “+91-9568740074” and “011-41447376”
  - Email: “info@dilss.in”
  - Company name: “Di Logisolution”
  - Registered address: “RZK-2/326-I, Khasra No. 85/17, Block K-2, Nihal Vihar, Nangaloi, West Delhi, Delhi, 11004”
- Replace remaining prominent “GlobalFreight” mentions in page headings/titles (e.g., hero headings and “Why Choose …” section heading) with the updated branding, keeping layout/structure unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The website consistently shows the new Di Logisolutions branding (logo + name) and displays the updated office/registered address, phone numbers, and email everywhere contact information appears, with no prominent “GlobalFreight” branding remaining.
