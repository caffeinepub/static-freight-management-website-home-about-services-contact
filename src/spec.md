# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a static, four-page freight management marketing website with a consistent layout, cohesive logistics-themed styling, and generated brand visuals.

**Planned changes:**
- Create 4 routes/pages: Home, About Us, Services, Contact Us, with consistent header navigation and a shared footer.
- Implement a responsive shared layout (header/main/footer) with company name/logo area, nav links, and footer contact placeholders.
- Home page: hero section with headline/subheadline and CTA to Contact Us; credibility highlights grid; services preview linking to Services.
- About Us page: Company Overview, Mission & Values, Why Choose Us sections; add a simple timeline or stats strip.
- Services page: multiple freight service categories displayed as cards with brief descriptions; include CTA linking to Contact Us.
- Contact Us page: static contact form with client-side validation and success state; show contact details and business hours placeholders.
- Apply a cohesive non-blue/purple logistics visual theme (palette, typography, spacing, buttons/cards) across all pages.
- Add generated static images (logo, hero, service icons) under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and reference them directly in the frontend.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a polished, responsive freight management brochure site, review service offerings and company info, and fill out a validated contact form that shows a success message (without sending).
